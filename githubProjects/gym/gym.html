          The Nicholas Recreation Center is UW-Madison’s most popular gym
          on-campus. As a result, it is often extremely packed and leads to long
          wait times.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Recreation and Wellbeing website offers a live tracker, in which
          the occupancy of the gym is recorded roughly every hour. I developed
          an HTML, CSS, and JS app that uses Python web scraping to chart this
          data over time. It updates as soon as the website data is changed and
          allows for daily and bi-weekly chart views. I also included
          functionality for UW’s other gym, The Shell.
          <br />
          <br />
          This app allows users to determine the best times to go to the gym to
          avoid wait times.
