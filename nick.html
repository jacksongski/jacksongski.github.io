            UW-Madison has over 40,000 students on campus. With one of the two
            major fitness centers closed for renovation, many students turn to
            the Nicholas Recreation Center (The Nick) for their workouts.
            Because all of UW’s student body is limited to one on-campus gym
            option, it can become extremely busy, with significantly longer wait
            times.

          <h3>
            I was never sure of the best time to go to The Nick, as it usually
            seemed to be packed, yet every so often it would be very quiet. The

              UW-Madison Recreation & Wellbeing website</a
            >
            offers a “live” tracker that updates approximately every hour, but
            in order to get any valuable data, I’d have to check constantly
            throughout the day to gauge the best time to go.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>
            So, I decided to create a way to keep a log on all of the
            occupancies recorded and graph them. I recently added functionality
            for UW's other major gym, The Shell. You can view the finished
            product here:

          <h2 style="color: #cdcfff">How It Works</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>
            The idea of the application is quite simple: collect data and log it
            on a graph.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>
            For the data collection side, I created a simple Python script that
            runs every five minutes on my Raspberry Pi. It scrapes the UW
            RecWell webpage for the desired data, and if the data has been
            updated, then it executes a SQL query to insert data onto a server.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>
            On the front-end side, I used chart.js which is an open-source data
            visualization library. When the page is opened, an Ajax GET request
            is executed, which runs a PHP script to fetch from the database. The
            data is then parsed, and displayed on the graph.
