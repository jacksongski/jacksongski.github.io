        <h2>Internal Tool For IT Team</h2>

          <h3>
            On the Verona, WI campus, Epic employs over 10,000 people in over 30
            different buildings. As a member of the Computer and Techonology
            Services team, my colleagues and I spend a good portion of time
            traversing the campus and making computer equipment deliveries. With
            each building having 150+ offices, navigating can be extremely time
            consuming.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>
            Epicâ€™s internal website currently has a map system, but for our use
            case it's very limited as it only allows you to search one office at
            a time. My team does deliveries for upwards of 20 people at once, so
            it is a huge hassle to search for each office individually.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <h3>
            To speed things up, I fully developed an internal tool that allows
            for input of any number of offices. It ouputs an interactive webpage
            with highlighted rooms on floor plan maps.

          <h3>
            When I first created this tool, it was very basic and lacked
            functionality. It would only work by taking input from a seperate
            internal webpage, and would display a hardly readable list of map
            images. Over the timeline of this project, I continued to scale the
            application to make it more user-friendly.

            <h4>UI Rework</h4>
            <h3>
              Because the original map components relied on existing PNG files,
              they were very hard to read; especially when using a 14" laptop
              screen. I refactored hundreds of lines of code to create polygons
              for each room object. This allowed me to add individual, readable
              labels and color-coding based on room type.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Hovercards</h4>
            <h3>
              The main drawback to using this map system was that it was not
              very interactive, and it did not allow the user to see office
              occupant information. I implemented hovercards so the user could
              view the occupant's name, team, role, tenure, calendar, and
              whether or not they were in the office. Additionally, I included
              quick links to the occupant's devices and profile within our
              internal site, along with easy methods of contact.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Custom Input</h4>
            <h3>
              Most deliveries were done based off a seperate internal tool, but
              a lot were done based off of arbitrary office lists. I added a
              feature to allow for custom input based on a user-entered list of
              offices. It also accounted for errors such as misformatting and
              building abbrevations.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Check-Off</h4>
            <h3>
              Implemented a check-off feature to make floor deliveries more
              efficient. Clicking on an office on the map would grey it out,
              allowing easy tracking of visited offices. Once all offices were
              visited, the entire map would be greyed out.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Printer-Friendly Maps</h4>
            <h3>
              Some of my colleagues prefer to leave their laptop behind during
              deliveries, as it takes up too much space. Added a "Print Maps"
              button for easy printing which would reformat the webpage for
              better readability on paper.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h4>Zoom</h4>
            <h3>
              With different employees working on different sized screens
              utilizing different workflows (full-screen view vs. split-screen),
              I added zoom controls. This way, you could easily zoom in closer
              on a map, or view multiple maps at a time.
