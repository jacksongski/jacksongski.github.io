          <h3>
            I worked with a partner for about a month to build a deployable
            Discord bot to be used for NFT-focused communities. The bot was
            named Argus, and it made a number of operations more streamlined and
            easier for Discord server administrators. These operations were
            executed by “slash commands” so that when an admin typed the command
            into the server chat, Python code was executed on the back-end.
          </h3>

        <div style="margin: 120px"></div>
        <div>
          <h2 style="color: #cdcfff">/setup</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>
            This slash command was created for a one-time use in a server. Once
            the admin sends “/setup” in the chat (usually in a blank, empty
            Discord server), the server would then be initialized with a
            template similar to popular NFT communities. The simple command
            would create multiple text channels, voice channels, and roles. The
            roles would be set up in a hierarchy, such that certain roles had
            more admin-like permissions an certain channels were limited to
            select roles. Additionally, in order to prevent accidents, if the
            command was entered by mistake, the admin would have to input a
            second confirmation, otherwise the command would time out. The setup
            command could also be undone.

        <div style="margin: 120px"></div>
        <div>
          <h2 style="color: #cdcfff">/opensea</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>
            OpenSea is a marketplace for NFTs, and Discord mods often like to
            track these sales of NFT contracts. When an admin would type the
            command with an NFT contract number, the bot would begin “tracking”
            that contract. So, when any sort of sale was made, a message
            containing the NFT thumbnail, name, collection, price, etc. were
            sent to that text channel. This was done through constant GET
            requests using the OpenSea API. This made it much easier for
            communities to see how well an NFT collection is selling.

          <br />
          <h3>
            As /setup and /opensea were the most involved commands, the majority
            of my effort was put into those. Here is a list of some of the other
            commands Argus could perform.
          </h3>
